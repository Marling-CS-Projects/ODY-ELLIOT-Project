# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game's objective is clear             | Success      |
| 2           | The game provides a challenge to the user | Success      |

### Feature 1

Due to Bucket Knight's simplistic design, the game's goals were clear to players as they could quickly figure out what the game wanted them to do and how to achieve it (as evidenced in [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/usability-testing.md)).

### Feature 2

The level of challenge the game provided sat in the Goldilox Zone for most users which makes the game more entertaining to play as it isn't too easy (which causes boredom) and not too hard (which causes frustration).
