# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Have a How-To-Play screen that explains the game's objective | Fail         |
| 2           | The game's objective is clear                                | Success      |

### Feature 1

The current How-To-Play screen only displays the controls of the game. This is not ideal as players new to gaming may not understand what to do and will stop playing after a few rounds. This needs to be fixed in future cycles.

### Feature 2

Due to Bucket Knight's simplistic design, the game's goals were clear to players as they could quickly figure out what the game wanted them to do and how to achieve it (as evidenced in [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/usability-testing.md)). This feature won't need to be developed further.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                              | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 3           | Have easy to use menus                   | Success      |
| 4           | Have responsive and easy-to-use controls | Success      |

### Feature 3

The game's Main Menu consists of two buttons: the Play button and the How-To-Play button. Both are large buttons and are well sign-posted so the user knows what each button does which makes the menu easy to navigate and use. This feature won't need to be changed in the future.

### Feature 4

The game has very basic controls which are easy to use making the game easy to pick up and play. The game's controls are now responsive (thanks to the fixes in [Cycle 12](../design-and-development/cycle-12.md)) so this feature won't need to be developed further unless new abilities are added which require their own keybinds.

{% hint style="info" %}
The form was created before [Cycle 12](../design-and-development/cycle-12.md) so some of the respondents played the game before the v1.2 Patch.
{% endhint %}

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description         | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 5           | Suitable Game Art   | Success         |
| 6           | Suitable Game Sound | Success         |
| 7           | Variety of Levels   | Partial Success |
| 8           | Variety of Weapons  | Success         |
| 9           | Variety of Enemies  | Success         |

### Feature 5

Everyone who played Bucket Knight liked the custom artwork made for it (evidenced by the graph below). This means this feature won't have to change and future assets will retain the same art style. One change that may be made in future development cycles is animating the sprites to make the game feel more lively.

### Feature 6

The game's sound effects were made using jsfxr and the music was created by Kevin MacLeod. The game's audio received a mostly positive reception and I have deemed it successful. However, in future development cycles, I would like to compose my own music for the game as well as add more soundtracks in order to add more variety as the same music can feel quite tedious after some time.

{% hint style="info" %}
jsfxr allows unrestricted commercial use and Kevin MacLeod's music can be used commercially if credited (which I have done).
{% endhint %}

### Feature 7

Currently, the game does have a variety of levels but they only vary visually as they don't generate unique obstacle/enemy patterns. Functionally, the only thing they vary on is the number of enemies that are spawned. I consider this a partial success and in future cycles other features, such as breakable boxes, may be added so the level variety increases: keeping players entertained.&#x20;

### Feature 8

In this version of the game, there are three types of weapons each with their own unique uses. This is successful for now but the game's future development will include more weapons added to the game, such as a shotgun-style weapon.

### Feature 9

There are three types of enemies in the game and each has unique stats and behaviours. This is a success for now, similar to the weapons, but more enemies may be added in future development cycles.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 10          | The game doesn't crash            | Success      |
| 11          | The game doesn't contain any bugs | Success      |

### Feature 10

For most users, the game downloaded and ran correctly implying that the game didn't crash. This means this is successful and its success will be maintained in future cycles.

### Feature 11

As shown below, there were quite a few bugs in my game on its first release. All of these bugs were fixed in [Cycle 11](../design-and-development/cycle-11.md) in response to a video and the Google Form posted on the store page so this is a successful feature.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                   | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| 12          | List the controls in-game     | Success      |
| 13          | Create easy-to-learn controls | Success      |

### Feature 12

The How-To-Play screen shows the player all the controls they need to play the game so it is easier for them to learn the game. This will remain a successful feature and will have to be improved upon if new controls are added.

### Feature 13

The controls share similarities with existing games and there aren't many of them. This makes the controls easy to learn and use in-game which makes this feature successful and one that doesn't have to be developed further.
