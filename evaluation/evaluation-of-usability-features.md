# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game's objective is clear             | Success      |
| 2           | The game provides a challenge to the user | Success      |

### Feature 1

Due to Bucket Knight's simplistic design, the game's goals were clear to players as they could quickly figure out what the game wanted them to do and how to achieve it (as evidenced in [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/usability-testing.md)). This feature won't need to be developed further.

### Feature 2

The level of challenge the game provided sat in the Goldilox Zone for most users which makes the game more entertaining to play as it isn't too easy (which causes boredom) and not too hard (which causes frustration). This feature doesn't need to be improved upon further but may be affected by future development as its success relies on the game as a whole.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                   | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| 3           | Have an easy to use Main Menu | Success      |
| 4           | Have easy to use controls     | Success      |

### Feature 3

The game's Main Menu consists of two buttons: the Play button and the How-To-Play button. Both are large buttons and are well sign-posted so the user knows what each button does which makes the menu easy to navigate and use. This feature won't need to be changed in the future.

### Feature 4

The game has very basic controls which are easy to use making the game easy to pick up and play. This feature won't need to be developed further unless new abilities are added which require their own keybinds.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description         | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 5           | Suitable Game Art   | Success         |
| 6           | Suitable Game Sound | Success         |
| 7           | Variety of Levels   | Partial Success |
| 8           | Variety of Weapons  | Success         |
| 9           | Variety of Enemies  | Success         |

### Feature 5

Everyone who played Bucket Knight liked the custom artwork made for it (evidenced by the graph below). This means this feature won't have to change and future assets will retain the same art style. One change that may be made in future development cycles is animating the sprites to make the game feel more lively.

### Feature 6

The game's sound effects were made using jsfxr and the music was created by Kevin MacLeod. The game's audio received a mostly positive reception and I have deemed it successful. However, in future development cycles, I would like to compose my own music for the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
jsfxr allows unrestricted commercial use and Kevin MacLeod's music can be used commercially if credited (which I have done).
{% endhint %}

### Feature 7

Currently, the game does have a variety of levels but they only vary visually as they don't generate unique obstacle/enemy patterns. Functionally, the only thing they vary on is the number of enemies that are spawned. I consider this a partial success and in future cycles other features, such as breakable boxes, may be added so the level variety increases: keeping players entertained.&#x20;

### Feature 8

In this version of the game, there are three types of weapons each with their own unique uses. This is successful for now but the game's future development will include more weapons added to the game, such as a shotgun-style weapon.

### Feature 9

There are three types of enemies in the game and each has unique stats and behaviours. This is a success for now, similar to the weapons, but more enemies may be added in future development cycles.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 10          | The game doesn't crash            | Success      |
| 11          | The game doesn't contain any bugs | Success      |

### Feature 10

For most users, the game downloaded and ran correctly implying that the game didn't crash. This means this is successful and its success will be maintained in future cycles.

### Feature 11

As shown below, there were quite a few bugs in my game on its first release. All of these bugs were fixed in [Cycle 11](../design-and-development/cycle-11.md) in response to a video and the Google Form posted on the store page so this is a successful feature.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 12          | List the controls in-game          | Success      |
| 13          | Explain how the game works in-game | Fail         |

### Feature 12

The How-To-Play screen shows the player all the controls they need to play the game so it is easier for them to learn the game. This will remain a successful feature and will have to be improved upon if new controls are added.

### Feature 13

Nowhere in the game explains how the features in the game work (such as weapon switching). Players normally learn how the game works after three or four rounds but this feature will need improvement in future development cycles as users are often surprised at features, such as weapons switching, when they first encounter it. A solution to this is creating a better How-To-Play screen which doesn't only contain the controls for the game but also text explaining the features in the game which may be confusing to newcomers.
