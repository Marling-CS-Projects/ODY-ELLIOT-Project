# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game's objective is clear             | Success      |
| 2           | The game provides a challenge to the user | Success      |

### Feature 1

Due to Bucket Knight's simplistic design, the game's goals were clear to players as they could quickly figure out what the game wanted them to do and how to achieve it (as evidenced in [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/usability-testing.md)). This feature won't need to be developed further.

### Feature 2

The level of challenge the game provided sat in the Goldilox Zone for most users which makes the game more entertaining to play as it isn't too easy (which causes boredom) and not too hard (which causes frustration). This feature doesn't need to be improved upon further but may be affected by future development as its success relies on the game as a whole.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                   | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| 3           | Have an easy to use Main Menu | Success      |
| 4           | Have easy to use controls     | Success      |

### Feature 3

The game's Main Menu consists of two buttons: the Play button and the How-To-Play button. Both are large buttons and are well sign-posted so the user knows what each button does which makes the menu easy to navigate and use. This feature won't need to be changed in the future.

### Feature 4

The game has very basic controls which are easy to use making the game easy to pick up and play. The How-To-Play menu also makes these controls easier to learn. This feature won't need to be developed further unless new abilities are added which require their own keybinds.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description         | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 5           | Suitable Game Art   | Success         |
| 6           | Suitable Game Sound | Success         |
| 7           | Variety of Levels   | Partial Success |
| 8           | Variety of Weapons  | Success         |
| 9           | Variety of Enemues  | Success         |

### Feature 5

Everyone who played Bucket Knight liked the custom artwork made for it (evidenced by the graph below). This means this feature won't have to change and future assets will retain the same art style. One change that may be made in future development cycles is animating the sprites to make the game feel more lively.

### Feature 6

The game's sound effects were made using jsfxr and the music was created by Kevin MacLeod. The game's audio received a mostly positive reception and I have deemed it successful. However, in future development cycles, I would like to compose my own music for the game.

### Feature 7

Currently, the game does have a variety of levels but they only vary visually as they don't generate unique obstacle/enemy patterns. Functionally, the only thing they vary on is the number of enemies that are spawned. I consider this a partial success and in future cycles other features, such as breakable boxes, may be added so the level variety increases: keeping players entertained.&#x20;

### Feature 8

In this version of the game, there are three types of weapons each with their own unique uses. This is successful for now but the game's future development will include more weapons added to the game, such as a shotgun-style weapon.
