| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                                                                      | Justification                                                                                                   | Reference                                                                       |
| :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     1    | The player should be able to move using the WASD keys.                                                                         | Allowing the player to move around the scene is a fundamental feature of most games.                            | [Movement](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)           |
|     2    | The player should be able to collide with the dungeon's walls.                                                                 | This prevents the player from going out of bounds and getting lost / accessing areas earlier than expected.     | [Collisions](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#collisions)       |
|     3    | The player should have a camera attached to them.                                                                              | This means that the player knows what they are doing and where they are.                                        | [Camera](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#camera)               |
|     4    | The player should be able to use a variety of weapons.                                                                         | This allows the player to defeat enemies and progress throughout the game.                                      | [Weapons](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons)             |
|     5    | The player should have a roll ability which they can to dodge attacks.                                                         | This makes the game more forgiving if the player gets into a situation without an exit without rolling.         | [Movement](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)           |
|     6    | When the player dies (health <= 0) a game over screen should be presented and then the user will be directed to the main menu. | This is necessary it allows the player to fail and, therefore, have to improve at the game to progress further. | [HP and Damage](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hp-and-damage) |
