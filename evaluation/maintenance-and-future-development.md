# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of the Project

* Variety of Weapons
* Variety of Enemies
* Variety of Levels
* Un-Animated Game Art
* Variety of Music
* Platform Support

These limitations can be changed, added to, and expanded upon in future development cycles to improve the game's user experience.

## Maintenance

Maintaining the game will require more resources as the game gets larger. At its current size, it would only take one person (me) to add new features and develop solutions to the project's current limitations. However, this is only a short-term solution because the project will increase in size after a certain point which would require a long-term solution where others would have to assist in developing the game.

To continue to make the game I would either have to make the game open source (on platforms such as GitHub) or pay people to develop and maintain the game to keep it commercial. If I go for the latter option, I will have to charge money for the game in order to pay for the maintenance and development of the game.

## Future Development

### Short-Term Plan

#### Testing & Bugs

I am currently unaware of any bugs that are in the current release of Bucket Knight (v1.2) as I have fixed all the bugs that were brought to my attention. To continue developing my game I would first test it vigorously to check for these mistakes to solve them.

#### Code Clean Up

Some parts of my code can be described as Spaghetti code, as it has no defined structure, so will be hard for other people to understand my code. This would make it impossible for efficient collaboration as the majority of the time spent working on the project would be understanding what is already there. To clean up the code I would make more features self-contained as well as stick to more code conventions (such as making Get functions for variables so they cannot be changed outside of their class). I could also add descriptive comments to my code to help people understand what is going on.

#### Level Variation

Something I could add in the short-term would be level variation. This would work by adding another tilemap file which would store the positions of objects to place in the levels (such as destructible crates). I could also add item pickups (such as a health potion) on these tilemaps or in the crates.

### Long-Term Plan

#### Art

An improvement in the art of the game may make it more engaging for players. This would involve hiring an artist to create a variety of new assets for the game as well as animations which will be implemented by a programmer.

#### Music & Sound Effects

This would involve commissioning a professional musician and foley artist to create a variety of audio assets for the game. Audio is important in games as it sets the atmosphere and gives feedback to the player on what is going on in the scene.

#### Levels & HUD

The level size will be increased in order to accommodate the new features you can find inside of them (such as crates). The HUD will also have to be changed to accommodate the larger level size.

#### Weapons & Enemies

More weapons and enemies will be added to the game to maintain the player-base's interest as well as attract new players.

#### Platform Support

The only way to play Bucket Knight is via a Windows computer which isn't good as it significantly reduces the amount of people who can play the game. To solve this, ports of the newest version will need to be created for other operating systems (such as MAC OS) as well as creating versions for different consoles (such as Nintendo Switch) and a version for mobile.
