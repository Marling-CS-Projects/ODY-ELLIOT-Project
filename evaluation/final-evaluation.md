# 4.4 Final Evaluation

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Bucket Knight has been an overall successful game due to positive user experience (based on feedback received from its players); achieving most of the goals I set out to do; and the lack of any bugs in the game. I believe the game is fun to play and has great potential for future development.
