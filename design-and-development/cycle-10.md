# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

The objective of this cycle is to release the game in order to receive feedback from the public.

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [x] Create a game installer
* [x] Create an itch.io page for Bucket Knight

### Usability Features

Installer - This makes it easier for players to download the game due to its reduced file size and it's a straightforward application to use.

Automatically add shortcuts - This makes it easier for players to locate and play the game. The shortcuts are added to the desktop and the start menu.
