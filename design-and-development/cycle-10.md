# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

The objective of this cycle is to release the game in order to receive feedback from the public.

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [x] Create a game installer
* [x] Create an itch.io page for Bucket Knight

### Usability Features

Installer - This makes it easier for players to download the game due to its reduced file size and it's a straightforward application to use.

Automatically add shortcuts - This makes it easier for players to locate and play the game. The shortcuts are added to the desktop and the start menu.

### Outcome

The outcome of the cycle (which you can find [here](https://github.com/Marling-CS-Projects/ODY-ELLIOT-Project/tree/main)) was making a 2MB file that new players could download online from [https://elliotody.itch.io/bucket-knight](https://elliotody.itch.io/bucket-knight) and extract the installer. The installer would then extract the game files and put them in the programs folder (unless the user chose a different folder to put the files in) as well as create a shortcut for the game in the start menu and the user's desktop.

I also added a small story to the itch.io page to add some more context for what the player is doing and hopefully make potential players more interested in playing the game.

### Challenges

The main challenge of this cycle was creating the installer as some of the code needed to be changed in order for it to work. For example, the tilemap system I created needed to be changed slightly in order for the game to run correctly once installed.

In the video above, I show the itch.io page for the game as well as how to install the game via the installer app.
