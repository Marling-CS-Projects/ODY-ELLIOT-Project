# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

This cycle is focused on better user experience which I will achieve by adding a How-To-Play screen (shown below) as well as implementing music and sound effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
The 'Roll' ability will be added in the next cycle.
{% endhint %}

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [x] Create a How-To-Play button
* [x] Create a How-To-Play Screen
* [x] Add a soundtrack that plays on an infinite loop
* [x] Add sound effects that play in response to an event occurring in the game

### Usability Features

How-To-Play - This feature will allow new players to quickly learn the game's controls allowing them to have a more enjoyable experience.

Volume Levels - More important SFX (sound effects) have a greater volume than others (such as the player being hit being louder than the enemies getting hit) which will alert the user to more significant events taking place above other, less significant events.

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
