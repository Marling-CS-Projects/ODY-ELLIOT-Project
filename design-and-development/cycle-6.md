# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

In this cycle, I will add a main menu which the player is sent to when they lose and an arcade-style scoring system so the player knows how far they have progressed.

As well as that, I will add a few new assets to improve the game's look.

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [x] Create a main menu with a Play Button
* [x] When a player loses, the scene will revert to the main menu
* [x] Create an arcade-style scoring system
* [x] Add some improved assets

### Usability Features

Game Loop - The player can now play the game multiple times without restarting the application which will reduce downtime leading to the player being engaged for longer.

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```
