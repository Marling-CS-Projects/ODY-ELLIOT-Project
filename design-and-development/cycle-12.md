# 2.2.12 Cycle 12

## Design

This cycle was to add features in response to player requests I received from the [Bucket Knight Response Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewdKSRPxViHy7iZwTl3iMBZkAM8XL76dQIEQXJQ5ZiwxuIdg/viewform). Most requests were to improve the balance of the weapons in the game, but there were some highly requested features I had to implement (such as a game-over screen).

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [x] Increase attack speed
* [x] Make the melee weapon centred&#x20;
* [x] Buff the melee weapon
* [x] Nerf the magic weapon
* [x] Add a pause menu
* [x] Add a game-over screen
* [x] Create a better movement input system

### Usability Features

Pause Menu - Allowing the player to pause will let them stop playing without losing progress in their current run.

Game Over Screen - This adds a delay between the player dying and the main menu to prevent accidental button presses.

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
