The diagram above shows different sections of the game which I'll focus on making. I have put my [success criteria](../analysis/success-criteria.md) headers and split them into smaller sub-sections which I can choose to focus on throughout the development cycle (1 or 2 at a time). As I complete these sub-sections, the game will slowly piece together.

## Usability Features

Usability is a vital aspect of my game as I want my game to be enjoyed by as many people as possible. To create the best possible user experience there are five key points which I will use while developing my project.

These are:

### Effective

Effective usability is when the user completes a target/goal with both completeness and accuracy. In order to achieve this, I will let the player know what their goal is via the "how to play" button in both the [Main Menu](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#main-menu) and the [Pause Menu](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#pause-menu). As well as that, I want to have a clear goal for the game so players can pick up and play without reading the "how to play" screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
The "how to play" screen is intended to be used by more inexperienced gamers because more experienced gamers are likely to just head straight into the game and understand it faster.
{% endhint %}

#### Aims

* Create a "How-To-Play" screen which explains the game's goals.
* Have a clear objective for the game.

### Efficiency

Efficiency refers to the speed and accuracy a user can complete a goal. To make an efficient game I will create a menu system which is intuitive and easy to navigate as well as an easy and responsive [control scheme](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls).

#### Aims

* Create a menu system that is intuitive and easy to navigate.
* Create an easy and responsive control scheme.

### Engaging

Engagement is arguably the most important usability feature as it requires the solution to be engaging for the player while playing. To achieve this, I will [graphics](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#sprite-inspiration) for my game that correctly represent the game's feel as well as backing this up with suitable [audio](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#sounds) to help immerse the player in the game world. I will also create a plethora of [levels](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#procedural-generation), [weapons](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons), and [enemies](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies) in order to keep the player engaged due to the variety these features will provide.

#### Aims

* Suitable Game Art
* Suitable Game Sound
* Variety of Levels
* Variety of Weapons
* Variety of Enemies

### Error Tolerant

The game must have as few errors as possible and, if an error occurs, it should be corrected by the solution. To do this, I will write code to manage a variety of scenarios and keep testing the game (trying to break it) to prevent it from crashing or breaking the game when someone is playing it.

#### Aims

* The game doesn't crash.
* The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience (e.g. going out of bounds)

### Easy To Learn

The game should be intuitive and not over-complicated as players often get frustrated when the game isn't responding to what they want to do. I will make the controls similar to other games so players can easily pick them up if they've played similar games. The controls also will be simple so new gamers can quickly learn how to play the game.

The "how to play" screen will also help players understand the [controls](../analysis/features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls).

#### Aims

* Create a "How-To-Play" screen.
* Create easy-to-learn controls.
