# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

## Design

In this cycle, I will add more enemies to the game as well as add a progression system so each level gets harder and harder.

The 'Goblin' enemy was the first enemy added to the game is shown on the left. It will have 3 health points (HP) and will move towards the player in order to deal damage. The 'Wizard' (shown on the right) has 1 HP and will stay still and damage the player via magic projectiles. The 'Furball' (shown in the middle) is a combination of the 'Goblin' and the 'Wizard' and has 2 HP. He moves towards the player slowly and fires projectiles.

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [x] Create the 'Wizard' enemy
* [x] Create the 'Furball' enemy
* [x] Create a suitable progression system
