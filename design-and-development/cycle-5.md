# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

This cycle will be an optimisation cycle where I will clean up code to make it easier to continue development.

As well as that, I will give the dungeon a more arcade-like system where the next room will spawn when all the enemies are defeated.

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will:

* [ ] Overhaul the dungeon progression system
* [ ] Improve the object creation system

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```
