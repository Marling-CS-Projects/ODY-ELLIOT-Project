# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to:

* [ ] Set up a C++ project in VS 2019
* [ ] Incorporate the SDL2 library into the project ([https://www.libsdl.org/](https://www.libsdl.org/))
* [ ] Create a blank, re-sizable window
* [ ] Render a sprite to that window
* [ ] Move the created sprite in a chosen direction

### Usability Features

* Controls - Simple controls as it currently will just be movement controls.
* Sprite Contrast - The sprite will have a white outline to contrast with the black background.
