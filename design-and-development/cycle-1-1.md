# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to:

* [x] Set up a C++ project in VS 2019
* [x] Incorporate the SDL2 library into the project ([https://www.libsdl.org/](https://www.libsdl.org/))
* [x] Create a black, re-sizable window
* [x] Render a sprite to that window
* [x] Move the sprite around the scene using WASD

### Usability Features

* Controls - Simple controls as it currently will just be movement controls.
* Sprite Contrast - The sprite will have a white outline to contrast with the black background.
