## Soul Knight

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cover image for the Nintendo Switch version of Soul Knight (<a href="references.md#soul-knight">Nintendo of Europe, 2019</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Soul Knight is a free-to-play ([Koziara, 2017](references.md#soul-knight)) 2D, top-down, rogue-lite made by Chillyroom for mobile devices (and Nintendo Switch) with over 50 million downloads on Android devices ([Fandom, 2017a](references.md#soul-knight)). The goal of the main game in Soul Knight is to reach the end of the dungeon and retrieve the ancient magic stones ([Fandom, 2017b](references.md#soul-knight)). It has WAN and LAN multiplayer options ([Fandom, 2017c](references.md#soul-knight)).

After the round is over (whether it be by death or reaching the goal) the player will receive some gems to upgrade his character and buy cosmetics which they can use in later runs: hence it being a rogue-lite.

The game boosts an arsenal of 120 weapons and each area consists of 5 levels culminating in a boss fight ([Koziara, 2017](references.md#soul-knight)) at the end of each area.

### Controls

As this game is a mobile game (with the exception of the Nintendo Switch release) the game uses touchscreen buttons for the player to interact with as well as a virtual joystick for movement (as seen below).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Soul Knight gameplay (<a href="references.md#soul-knight">Gamer Ray, 2021</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

Soul Knight also has auto-aim ([Koziara, 2017](references.md#soul-knight)) as it would otherwise be difficult to target enemies.&#x20;

These controls make it easy to pick up and play this game as every major function is a button-press away from being executed.

### Features

In these tabs I will say what I want to include, may include (due to estimated difficulty or not necessary for the first release of the game), and what I don't want to include.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Features I will include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chests</td><td>Soul Knight's chests contain coins and mana pickups, a weapon, or a health pick-up. Chests allow progression in rogue-like games as new weapons allow the player to progress further in the dungeon.</td></tr><tr><td>Simple Animation </td><td>The player in Soul Knight uses paper cut-out animation (similar to the Paper Mario franchise) which will be easier to implement. As well as that, weapons are held separate from the player so unique animations for each weapon aren't necessary.</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Classes</td><td>Soul Knight contains a plethora of weapons which can be assigned to classes to make it easier to program and help the player understand how that weapon works based on their previous experiences with that class. e.g. Melee weapons are close range.</td></tr><tr><td>End Goal</td><td>After a certain number of levels, the player reaches a magic crystal shard. This is good as it stops the player from becoming so overpowered and finding the game boring.</td></tr><tr><td>Health HUD</td><td>The health bar is always a good choice to show the player how much health they currently have.</td></tr><tr><td>Artwork</td><td>Soul Knight's artwork is simple and defined so the player knows what is going on at all times.</td></tr></tbody></table>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Features I won't include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Upgrading outside of the Dungeon</td><td>Soul Knight is a rogue-lite meaning it doesn't contain permadeath. Outside of the dungeon you can upgrade characters and gain new abilities using gems and resources which I cannot include as I am making a rogue-like (which requires no progression outside of the dungeon).</td></tr><tr><td>Event Rooms</td><td>In Soul Knight there are event rooms marked with a yellow "!" (<a href="references.md#soul-knight">Fandom, 2017</a><a href="references.md#soul-knight">d</a>). These rooms can contain chests but usually contain shops to buy things to help your run succeed and mercenaries. I won't include these rooms as I plan to include more chests throughout each room so these rooms will become trivialized.</td></tr><tr><td>Unique Characters</td><td>This would cause progression outside of the dungeon as you unlock new characters so I have left this feature out of my rogue-like game.</td></tr><tr><td>Merchants</td><td>Although merchants are in a lot of rogue-like and rogue-lite games, merchants may ruin the story/feel of the game as a dangerous dungeon wouldn't contain people selling goods.</td></tr><tr><td>Energy</td><td>Energy makes certain weapons undesirable due to their expensive costs.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Moonlighter

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cover image for the Nintendo Switch version of Moonlighter (<a href="references.md#moonlighter">Nintendo of Europe, 2018</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Moonlighter is also a top-down 2D rogue-lite game made for PC, and console by Digital Sun ([Digital Sun, 2022](references.md#moonlighter)). The goal of the game is to unlock the mysterious 5th dungeon and run a successful shop with the items the player finds in the dungeons. It hasn't got multiplayer support.

From the shop, the player can get money in order to purchase new equipment and potions in order to traverse the dungeons easily and obtain the keys to unlock the final dungeon by defeating the bosses.

### Controls

As I only have played Moonlighter on PC, I will be talking about its PC controls only.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Moonlighter's keyboard controls (<a href="references.md#moonlighter">HotAndCrunchy, 2020</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

Moonlighter uses the WASD keys for movement and the keys depicted in the picture for attacking \[J], rolling \[Space], healing \[E], switching weapons \[Z], and using weapon abilities \[K].

### Features

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Features I will include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Weapon Switching</td><td>Allows for two weapons to be held at a time which makes the game more fun as you can switch between different weapons for more combat options.</td></tr><tr><td>Portable Healing</td><td>In Moonlighter, potions are portable so they can be used when you want them to be used. This will be good so people can stack healing (up to a maximum amount) so they can take on the boss at full health.</td></tr><tr><td>8 Direction Movement</td><td>Allows for movement in 8 directions.</td></tr><tr><td>Dungeon Generation</td><td>Moonlighter's dungeon generation makes rooms filled with enemies and destructible cover. It also generates chests in some rooms, to acquire loot, and doesn't generate corridors (unlike Soul Knight) making dungeon traversal easier and quicker.</td></tr><tr><td>Control UI</td><td>The UI elements have their respective controls represented next to them so the player knows how to access them at all times.</td></tr></tbody></table>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Features I won't include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Items</td><td>There is no need for obsolete items (such as artefacts) as there won't be a shop to sell them at.</td></tr><tr><td>Shop</td><td>The premise of Moonlighter is to run a shop to get money for your expeditions to the dungeon but this isn't needed in my game as a rogue-like wouldn't allow progression outside of the main game.</td></tr><tr><td>Secret Dungeons</td><td>The wanderer dungeon is a secret dungeon you can find in Moonlighter but I won't include something similar as it may ruin progression.</td></tr><tr><td>Money</td><td>Money isn't needed as there won't be shops to purchase goods.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Enter the Gungeon

### Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the Gungeon Box Art (<a href="references.md#enter-the-gungeon">Crooks, 2016</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

One of the main mechanics of this game is the dodge roll (which the creators liked so much they named their company after it) which is designed to help players avoid the onslaught of projectiles fired at them from the bad guys.



Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell rogue-like, rated PEGI 7, made for console and PC by Dodge Roll ([Robinson, 2016](references.md#enter-the-gungeon)). You take on the role of a Gungeoneer with unique abilities and a weapon and must venture into the Gungeon to find a gun that can kill the past. In the Gungeon the player will encounter many enemies and bosses, each firing loads of projectiles, and, in true rogue-like fashion, the player will lose everything upon death (permadeath). It also has multiplayer options.

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A screenshot from Enter the Gungeon (<a href="references.md#enter-the-gungeon">Williams, 2016</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

The main controls revolve around the WASD keys and the mouse (in the PC version). WASD is used for 8-directional movement. The mouse is used for aiming your gun and left click fires your gun. As well as that, the right click activates the dodge roll ability so the player can avoid bullets.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Control screen from Enter the Gungeon (<a href="references.md#enter-the-gungeon">Mr.Nails, 2016</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

There are a lot more controls in Enter the Gungeon than just those few (as shown above) which can be confusing for new players (especially if they haven't played many video games beforehand).

### Features

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Features I will include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dodge Roll</td><td>It is a good traversal ability as well as a good combat utility option.</td></tr><tr><td>AI Enemies</td><td>AI enemies that use similar weapons to the player are fun to fight against.</td></tr><tr><td>Bosses</td><td>A final boss for each level will act as a skill wall so the player doesn't feel the difficulty spike up when proceeding deeper into the dungeon.</td></tr><tr><td>Permadeath</td><td>A necessary aspect of a rogue-like game.</td></tr><tr><td>Art-style</td><td>The characters look good in Enter the Gungeon and I wish to recreate a similar pixel-art art-style. This can be mixed will Soul Knight's art-style to create a unique art-style for my game.</td></tr></tbody></table>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Features I won't include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Different Starting Characters </td><td>Due to constraints on this project I feel like I cannot make each character unique enough to justify its existence in the game.</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplayer</td><td>Multiplayer will be difficult to implement so I will leave it out of this project.</td></tr><tr><td>Loads of Weapons</td><td>This will be hard to implement and may result in weapons being buffed/nerfed reskins of other weapons.</td></tr><tr><td>References to Tobacco and other Adult Themes</td><td>Though it is rated PEGI 7, Enter the Gungeon has references to topics that would raise my PEGI rating (which goes against what I've said in <a href="stakeholders.md">Stakeholders</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## PEGI Rating

My game is going to have aspects of all these games and these games are all rated PEGI 7 and contain more adult themes (such as references and use of tobacco) so my game will definitely fit my criteria of a low-rated game (previously mentioned in my [Stakeholders](stakeholders.md) section).
