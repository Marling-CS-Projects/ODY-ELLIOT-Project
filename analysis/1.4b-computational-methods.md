## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction is the process of removing any unnecessary details from a problem so the problem is easier to solve as you can focus on the core details. Abstraction is important for game design as most problems are really complex but abstraction allows for simplification which, in turn, allows for the developer to solve the smaller problems and, eventually, solve the large problems they originally set out to solve.

Examples where I will use abstraction are:

* Dungeon generation algorithms
* Enemy behaviors
* Weapons

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is about thinking about the preconditions and inputs needed and the output of the problem. Thinking ahead allows us to think about the game we are creating and the steps for how to get to the solution.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
