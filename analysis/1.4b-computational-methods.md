## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction is the process of removing any unnecessary details from a problem so the problem is easier to solve as you can focus on the core details. Abstraction is important for game design as most problems are really complex but abstraction allows for simplification which, in turn, allows for the developer to solve the smaller problems and, eventually, solve the large problems they originally set out to solve.

Examples:

* A video game controller is a complex machine with many parts but it is simplified to only a few button inputs.
* A car's inner workings are very complicated but it is simplified for the user as they only need to focus on the accelerator, brake, and steering.
* Following a recipe is a step-by-step process rather than throwing all the information at you in one go.

After abstracting problems, we can use diagrams to visualize the steps required to get to the solution and solve the large problem step-by-step.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead in computer science means considering what may happen in the future and using that information to make smart decisions or design better systems. It's predicting what could go wrong or what might be needed ahead of time so that you can be prepared which leads to more efficient and user-friendly solutions.

Places, where I may use this technique, are in functions and performance optimization.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Thinking procedurally and decomposition in computer science involve breaking down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks which have a clear sequence of steps to solve them. This allows game developers to develop software that is efficient at solving complex problems.

Example:

* When making a cup of tea there you can decompose the task into sub-tasks like 'boil the kettle' and 'get the milk out of the fridge'. Then you can create a procedure to follow these sub-tasks in order and eventually make a cup of tea.

Thinking procedurally and decomposition goes well with visualization as the diagrams created are done step-by-step.

## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically in computer science involves systematically analyzing problems and breaking them down into smaller parts, identifying patterns, and using logic to arrive at accurate conclusions. It is crucial for problem-solving, algorithm design, and programming as it enables programmers to create logical sequences and address errors. Logical thinking helps computer scientists develop effective solutions for complex computational problems.

Examples:

* All birds have feathered wings -> A parrot has feathered wings -> A parrot is a bird.
* All trees have trunks -> A birch tree is a tree -> A birch tree has a trunk.

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently refers to determining which parts of a piece of software can be designed to perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. This entails multiple tasks sharing computational resources in order to execute complex programs correctly.

Concurrent thinking is essential for game design as there is usually more than one thing happening at a given time which results in many processes having to be calculated every frame.

Example:

* Every frame the player needs to be updated, enemies need to be updated, inputs have to be registered, the screen needs to be refreshed, etc.
