## Age ratings

In Europe, games are rated by PEGI (Pan European Game Information) and, in North America, games are rated by the ERSB (The Entertainment Software Rating Board) ([https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature\_lifting\_the\_curtain\_on\_game\_ratings\_and\_the\_headache\_of\_worldwide\_releases](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature\_lifting\_the\_curtain\_on\_game\_ratings\_and\_the\_headache\_of\_worldwide\_releases)). The purpose of these ratings is to inform the buyer (mainly parents) of the game's contents and help the consumer choose age-appropriate games ([https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/video-games-age-ratings-explained/](https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/video-games-age-ratings-explained/)). For example, you wouldn't choose a PEGI 18 game for a child.

## Target audience

According to a survey on Reddit ([https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScR2iR\_lln4O4x8gh9DuDXzfJTDmsaczXYm633TzQZndBv8Cg/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScR2iR\_lln4O4x8gh9DuDXzfJTDmsaczXYm633TzQZndBv8Cg/viewanalytics)),  over 90% of people who play rogue-likes / rogue-lites are over the age of 18 and around 95% of the players are male. This means that rogue-like games don't have to cater for younger audiences as those players don't even make up 10% of the rogue-like player-base. However this survey may be skewed as the data was harvested on r/roguelike ([https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/)) which mainly consists of those previously mentioned demographics; the 61% of Reddit users are male and 18 to 29 year olds make up 64% of the users ([https://thrivemyway.com/reddit-statistics/](https://thrivemyway.com/reddit-statistics/)).

This means that a higher rating is acceptable but a lower rating is needed just in case the data has been skewed.

## How PEGI games are rated

As I live in Europe, PEGI is the standard game rating system so PEGI are the ones who are going to rate my game.

According to the official PEGI website [https://pegi.info/](https://pegi.info/)

> The PEGI rating considers the age suitability of a game, not the level of difficulty. A PEGI 3 game will not contain any inappropriate content, but can sometimes be too difficult to master for younger children. Reversely, there are PEGI 18 games that are very easy to play, yet they contain elements that make them inappropriate for a younger audience ([https://pegi.info/page/pegi-age-ratings#:\~:text=The%20PEGI%20rating%20considers%20the,to%20master%20for%20younger%20children.](https://pegi.info/page/pegi-age-ratings)).

To consider the suitability of the game, PEGI judges against its content descriptors. For example, a game with bad language will be given a minimum of PEGI 12 ([https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean)).
