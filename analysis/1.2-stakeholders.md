# 1.2 Stakeholders

## How many gamers are there?

In January 2023, there around 3.24 billion gamers worldwide and it is a close 1:1 ratio between men and women who play video-games ([https://dataprot.net/statistics/gamer-demographics/#:\~:text=There%20are%203.24%20billion%20gamers,billion%20people%20are%20PC%20gamers.](https://dataprot.net/statistics/gamer-demographics/)). &#x20;

## Age ratings

In Europe, games are rated by PEGI (Pan European Game Information) and, in North America, games are rated by the ERSB (The Entertainment Software Rating Board) ([https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature\_lifting\_the\_curtain\_on\_game\_ratings\_and\_the\_headache\_of\_worldwide\_releases](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature\_lifting\_the\_curtain\_on\_game\_ratings\_and\_the\_headache\_of\_worldwide\_releases)). The purpose of these ratings is to inform the buyer (mainly parents) of the game's contents and help the consumer choose age-appropriate games ([https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/video-games-age-ratings-explained/](https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/video-games-age-ratings-explained/)). For example, you wouldn't choose a PEGI 18 game for a child.

## How PEGI games are rated

As I live in Europe, PEGI is the standard game rating system so PEGI are the ones who are going to rate my game.

> The PEGI rating considers the age suitability of a game, not the level of difficulty. A PEGI 3 game will not contain any inappropriate content, but can sometimes be too difficult to master for younger children. Reversely, there are PEGI 18 games that are very easy to play, yet they contain elements that make them inappropriate for a younger audience ([https://pegi.info/page/pegi-age-ratings#:\~:text=The%20PEGI%20rating%20considers%20the,to%20master%20for%20younger%20children.](https://pegi.info/page/pegi-age-ratings)).
