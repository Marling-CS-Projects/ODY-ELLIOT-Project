## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction involves the process of simplifying complex problems by eliminating unrelated or irrelevant details, making problem-solving more efficient. This concept plays a vital role in game design, where intricate challenges need to be simplified. Using abstraction, developers can tackle smaller issues, which ultimately conquer the larger challenges they originally set out to address.

Examples:

* A video game controller is comprised of a number of components to function properly, yet it's streamlined to require the user to learn only a few button inputs.
* A car's internal mechanisms are complex, but they've been simplified for the user, who only needs to concentrate on fundamental functions such as acceleration, braking, and steering.
* Sticking to a recipe is presented as a sequential process which stops the user from being overwhelmed by providing all the information at once.

After abstracting problems, we can use flowcharts to visualize the steps required to tackle the small problems and eventually achieve the solution to the larger problem at hand.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead in computer science means considering what may happen in the future and using that information to make smart decisions or design better systems. It's predicting what could go wrong or what might be needed ahead of time so that you can be prepared which leads to more efficient and user-friendly solutions.

Places, where I may use this technique, are in functions and performance optimization.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Thinking procedurally and decomposition in computer science involve breaking down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks which have a clear sequence of steps to solve them. This allows game developers to develop software that is efficient at solving complex problems.

Example:

* When making a cup of tea you can decompose the task into sub-tasks like 'boil the kettle' and 'get the milk out of the fridge'. Then you can create a procedure to follow these sub-tasks in order and eventually make a cup of tea.

Thinking procedurally and decomposition goes well with visualization as the diagrams created are done step-by-step.

## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically in computer science involves systematically analyzing problems and breaking them down into smaller parts, identifying patterns, and using logic to arrive at accurate conclusions. It is crucial for problem-solving, algorithm design, and programming as it enables programmers to create logical sequences and address errors. Logical thinking helps computer scientists develop effective solutions for complex computational problems.

Examples:

* All birds have feathered wings -> A parrot has feathered wings -> A parrot is a bird.
* All trees have tree trunks -> A birch tree is a tree -> A birch tree has a tree trunk.

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently refers to determining which parts of a piece of software can be designed to perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. This entails multiple tasks sharing computational resources in order to execute complex programs correctly.

In game design, concurrent thinking is vital because multiple events typically take place simultaneously, leading to numerous processes occurring in each frame.

Example:

* Every frame the player needs to be updated, enemies need to be updated, inputs have to be registered, the screen needs to be refreshed, etc.
