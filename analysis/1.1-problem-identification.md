# 1.1 Problem Identification

## The current state of the game industry

In 1982, the video-game industry first overtook the Hollywood movie industry ([Patience, 2022](../references.md)) and now video-games have been dominating the entertainment market ever since. But now, due to recent events, the gaming market has exploded ([https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/gaming-pandemic-lockdowns-pwc-growth/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/gaming-pandemic-lockdowns-pwc-growth/)) as new players pick-up their controllers for the first time.

The COVID-19 pandemic was a leading factor of gaming's recent boom ([Witkowski, 2020](../references.md)). During the lockdowns in 2020, 62% of UK adults and 70% of children were playing video-games ([https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/apr/28/62-of-uk-adults-played-computer-games-during-the-pandemic-says-ofcom](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/apr/28/62-of-uk-adults-played-computer-games-during-the-pandemic-says-ofcom)), due to the extra free-time the pandemic provided.

This influx of new gamers as well as the increased retention of the market's existing players is due to the benefits that computer-games provide. Games can provide and improve problem-solving skills as well as strengthen a range of cognitive skills such as spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception ([https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/video-game](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/video-game)) However, more importantly, video games improve mental health as they ward of anxiety, give a sense of accomplishment, and help people socialize over the internet ([https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-benefits-of-video-games#:\~:text=Mental%20health%20recovery.\&text=Video%20games%20can%20act%20as,traumatic%20stress%20disorder%20(PTSD).](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-benefits-of-video-games)). With 84% of people who play saying that their mental health has improved and 71% saying it has made them feel less isolated ([https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/work-life/mind-games-how-gaming-can-play-a-positive-role-in-mental-health/](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/work-life/mind-games-how-gaming-can-play-a-positive-role-in-mental-health/)), it is no wonder why video-games have boomed in this digital era and especially during the pandemic's lockdowns.

## How video-games work

The primary aim of a video-game is to provide the player with enjoyment ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219301153#:\~:text=This%20could%20include%20gaming%20for,coping%20method%20or%20stress%20management.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219301153)). This is mainly done by giving the player a sense of achievement by using a risk vs. reward system.&#x20;

For example, in the arcade game space invaders the alien enemies shoot directly down at the player and, likewise, the player shoots directly up at the enemies. The bunkers are there to provide protection for the player. Here is a good example of risk and reward. Staying in the bunkers isn't that risky but you cannot attack the enemy. Going outside the bunker is risky, as you can die, but you get rewarded by defeating the enemies, increasing your score, and, hopefully, winning the game.

In rogue-like games (games that resemble the game Rogue \[1980] ([https://happygamer.com/rogue-the-game-that-spawned-an-entire-genre-in-1980-has-released-on-steam-89152/](https://happygamer.com/rogue-the-game-that-spawned-an-entire-genre-in-1980-has-released-on-steam-89152/))) the risk is going deeper into the dungeon and attacking enemies. Due to the main feature of a rogue-like being permadeath ([https://www.cbr.com/roguelike-game-genre-good/#:\~:text=Good%20roguelikes%20always%20have%20a,feel%20repetitive%20or%20too%20difficult.](https://www.cbr.com/roguelike-game-genre-good/))
