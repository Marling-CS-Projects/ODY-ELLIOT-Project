# 1.1 Problem Identification

## The current state of the game industry

In 1982, the video-game industry first overtook the Hollywood movie industry ([Patience, 2022](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)) and now video-games have been dominating the entertainment market ever since. But now, due to recent events, the gaming market has exploded ([Read, 2022](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)) as new players pick-up their controllers for the first time.

The COVID-19 pandemic was a leading factor of gaming's recent boom ([Witkowski, 2020](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)). During the lockdowns in 2020, 62% of UK adults and 70% of children were playing video-games ([Waterson, 2021](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)), due to the extra free-time the pandemic provided.

This influx of new players as well as the increased retention of the market's existing players is due to the benefits that computer-games provide. Games can provide and improve problem-solving skills as well as strengthen a range of cognitive skills such as spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception ([Bowen, 2014](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)). However, more importantly, video games improve mental health as they ward of anxiety, give a sense of accomplishment, and help people socialize over the internet ([WebMD, 2021](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)). With 84% of people who play saying that their mental health has improved and 71% saying it has made them feel less isolated ([Bach, 2021](../references.md#the-current-state-of-the-game-industry)), it is no wonder why video-games have boomed in this digital era and especially during the pandemic's lockdowns.

## Risk and reward in computer-games

The primary aim of a video-game is to provide the user with entertainment by making the game a fun experience for the player ([Corona, 2020](../references.md#risk-and-reward-in-computer-games)). This is mainly done by giving the player a sense of achievement by using a risk vs. reward system.&#x20;

For example, in the arcade game space invaders the alien enemies shoot directly down at the player and, likewise, the player shoots directly up at the enemies. The bunkers are there to provide protection for the player. Here is a good example of risk and reward. Staying in the bunkers isn't that risky but you cannot attack the enemy. Going outside the bunker is risky, as you can die, but you get rewarded by defeating the enemies, increasing your score, and, hopefully, winning the game.

## Concerning rogue-like games

In rogue-like games (games that resemble the game Rogue \[1980] ([Miller, 2020](../references.md#concerning-rogue-like-games)) the risk is going deeper into the dungeon (or an equivalent environment) and attacking enemies. Due to the main feature of a rogue-like being permadeath ([Creswell, 2022](../references.md#concerning-rogue-like-games)) the risk is very high as all your current run's progress is lost. However, the reward is player development and progression ([Creswell, 2022](../references.md#concerning-rogue-like-games)). Every run the player will get better at the game so they have the skills to progress further and further into the dungeon giving the player a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment out of the experience.

However, there are problems with the rogue-like formula. If a player doesn't gradually get better at the game they could find it too easy so they don't keep playing or too difficult were they drop the game out of frustration. Players also get frustrated as they lose all their progress due to a negative "coin-toss" ([Gough, 2020](../references.md#concerning-rogue-like-games)) causing them to put-down the game.

## Rogue-like popularity

On Steam (a platform to distribute games ([Khan, 2022](../references.md#rogue-like-popularity))) the most popular tag is the "Rogue-like Deck-builder" tag which only houses 99 games (released in the last 3 years) ([zukalous, 2022](../references.md#rogue-like-popularity)) which shows a real hunger from fans of those games and other rogue-likes as they share similar characteristics. As well as that, some of the most popular rogue-likes have had over 70,000 users online at the same time, such as "The Binding of Isacc: Rebirth", ([SteamDB, 2023](../references.md#rogue-like-popularity)) which also highlights their popularity as a video-game genre.

Rogue-like games are surging in popularity during recent years ([Richards, 2017](../references.md#rogue-like-popularity)) due to their challenging game-play, sense of progression, and high replay-ability ([Creswell, 2022](../references.md#rogue-like-popularity)). With the right balance of risk and reward, these games can provide players with a rewarding and enjoyable experience that keeps them coming back for more.
