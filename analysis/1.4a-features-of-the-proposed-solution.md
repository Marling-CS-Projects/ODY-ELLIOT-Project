# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Player

### Movement

#### 8 Directional Movement

The player will have 8 directional movement (similar to [Soul Knight](1.3-research-the-problem.md#soul-knight), [Moonlighter](1.3-research-the-problem.md#moonlighter), and [Enter the Gungeon](1.3-research-the-problem.md#enter-the-gungeon)) which will be controlled using the WASD keys.

{% hint style="info" %}
Holding \[W] will cause the player to move up ↑

Holding \[A] will cause the player to move left ←

Holding \[S] will cause the player to move right →

Holding \[D] will cause the player to move down ↓
{% endhint %}

A combination of these inputs will allow diagonal movement (e.g. W and S will cause the player to move up and to the right ↗) hence 8 directional movement.

#### Rolling

In both [Moonlighter](1.3-research-the-problem.md#moonlighter) and [Enter the Gungeon](1.3-research-the-problem.md#enter-the-gungeon) the roll mechanic is vital for dodging attacks as well as movement around the dungeons. The roll will grant the player increased velocity in their current direction as well as invincibility for a short period of time. The roll will be activated using \[Space].

### Character

#### Sprite Inspiration

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2114943348">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2114943348</a></td><td>I like the simplicity of the Gungeoneers' designs in <a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#enter-the-gungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a>.</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png">image (2).png</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.pngkit.com/view/u2w7r5e6e6w7y3y3_shovel-knight-shovel-knight-pixel-sprite/">https://www.pngkit.com/view/u2w7r5e6e6w7y3y3_shovel-knight-shovel-knight-pixel-sprite/</a></td><td>I like how Shovel Knight's helmet is designed. I particularly like the "T" being colored black. </td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (2).png">image (3) (2).png</a></td></tr><tr><td><br><a href="https://soul-knight.fandom.com/es/wiki/Caballero">https://soul-knight.fandom.com/es/wiki/Caballero</a></td><td>I like how the Knight character from <a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#soul-knight">Soul Knight</a> is textured and colored.</td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png">image (11).png</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

My character will be a mixture of all three of these designs and I have name him "Bucket Knight".

#### Animation

I like [Enter the Gungeon](1.3-research-the-problem.md#enter-the-gungeon)'s bouncy animations (as shown in the spritesheet above) as it gives the game a good amount of character. This combined with [Soul Knight](1.3-research-the-problem.md#soul-knight)'s paper cut-out animation style would make for a great, unique animation style.

## Enemies

## Story

A common video game trope is "Save the Princess"([https://tropedia.fandom.com/wiki/Save\_the\_Princess](https://tropedia.fandom.com/wiki/Save\_the\_Princess)) as it provides a simple goal for the player to achieve and gives them a sense of fulfillment as well.

### Examples of Games that "Save the Princess"

### My Story

In my game you will be playing a character named "Bucket Knight" where your goal is to "Save the Princess" from the evil forces acting in the dungeon. The knight will travel through the dungeon, picking up weapons along the way, and fight enemies to save her.
