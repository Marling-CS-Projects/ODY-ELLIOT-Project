# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Player

### Movement

#### 8 Directional Movement

The player will have 8 directional movement (similar to [Soul Knight](1.3-research-the-problem.md#soul-knight), [Moonlighter](1.3-research-the-problem.md#moonlighter), and [Enter the Gungeon](1.3-research-the-problem.md#enter-the-gungeon)) which will be controlled using the WASD keys.

{% hint style="info" %}
Holding \[W] will cause the player to move up ↑

Holding \[A] will cause the player to move left ←

Holding \[S] will cause the player to move right →

Holding \[D] will cause the player to move down ↓
{% endhint %}

A combination of these inputs will allow diagonal movement (e.g. W and S will cause the player to move up and to the right ↗) hence 8 directional movement.

#### Rolling

In both [Moonlighter](1.3-research-the-problem.md#moonlighter) and [Enter the Gungeon](1.3-research-the-problem.md#enter-the-gungeon) the roll mechanic is vital for dodging attacks as well as movement around the dungeons. The roll will grant the player increased velocity in their current direction as well as invincibility for a short period of time. The roll will be activated using \[Space].

### Character
