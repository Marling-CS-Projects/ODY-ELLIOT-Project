|     1    | The player should be able to move using the WASD keys.                 | Allowing the player to move around the scene is a fundamental feature of most games.                        | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)     |
|     2    | The player should be able to collide with the dungeon's walls.         | This prevents the player from going out of bounds and getting lost / accessing areas earlier than expected. | [Collisions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#collisions) |
|     3    | The player should have a camera attached to them.                      | This means that the player knows what they are doing and where they are.                                    | [Camera](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#camera)         |
|     4    | The player should be able to pick-up and use weapons.                  | This allows the player to defeat enemies and progress throughout the game.                                  | [Weapons](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons)       |
|     5    | The player should have a roll ability which they can to dodge attacks. | This makes the game more forgiving if the player gets into a situation without an exit without rolling.     | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)     |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
