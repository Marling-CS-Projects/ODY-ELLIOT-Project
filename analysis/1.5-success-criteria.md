|     1    | The player should be able to move using the WASD keys.                 | Allowing the player to move around the scene is a fundamental feature of most games.                        | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)     |
|     2    | The player should be able to collide with the dungeon's walls.         | This prevents the player from going out of bounds and getting lost / accessing areas earlier than expected. | [Collisions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#collisions) |
|     3    | The player should have a camera attached to them.                      | This means that the player knows what they are doing and where they are.                                    | [Camera](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#camera)         |
|     4    | The player should be able to pick-up and use weapons.                  | This allows the player to defeat enemies and progress throughout the game.                                  | [Weapons](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons)       |
|     5    | The player should have a roll ability which they can to dodge attacks. | This makes the game more forgiving if the player gets into a situation without an exit without rolling.     | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)     |

## Enemies

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                                                   | Justification                                                                                           | Reference                                                            |

|     7    | The enemies should be able to move towards and around the player.                                           | This makes the enemies more of a challenge and, therefore, makes the game more enjoyable.               | [Enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies)         |
|     8    | Each enemy should be assigned a rarity on creation and better rarities will be more common in later levels. | This will be a major part in game progressions as later levels should be harder than the previous ones. | [Progression](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#progression) |
|     9    | There should be at least 1 unique enemy in each class.                                                      | This allows for multiple classes in the game.                                                           | [Enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies)         |
|    10    | The boss needs to appear on the last level and be the most difficult opponent of the game.                  | This gives the player a sense of achievement when they beat the game.                                   | [Enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies)         |

|    11    | There needs to be an easy way to build rooms.                | This will make the development process faster as there needs to be an array of pre-built rooms to choose from in order to generate dungeons. | [Procedural ](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#procedural-generation)[Generation](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#procedural-generation) |

|    13    | Each room generated needs to have a chance to spawn a chest. | This will allow the player to get better weapons to survive longer.                                                                          | [Procedural ](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#procedural-generation)[Generation](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#procedural-generation) |
