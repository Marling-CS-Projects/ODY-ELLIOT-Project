## Soul Knight

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cover image for the Nintendo Switch version of Soul Knight (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Soul-Knight-1652172.html">https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Soul-Knight-1652172.html</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Soul Knight is a 2D, top-down, rogue-lite made more mobile devices (and Nintendo Switch). The goal of the main game in Soul Knight is to reach the end of the dungeon, using weapons they find on the way, and collect a fragments of the ancient magic stones. It has WAN and LAN multiplayer options.

After the round is over (whether it be by death or reaching the goal) the player will receive some gems to upgrade his character and buy cosmetics which they can use in later runs: hence it being a rogue-lite.

### Controls

As this game is a mobile game (with the exception of the Nintendo Switch release) the game uses touchscreen buttons for the player to interact with as well as a virtual joystick for movement (as seen below).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Soul Knight gameplay (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfVI077M6k&#x26;t=754s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBfVI077M6k&#x26;t=754s</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

As it is on a mobile device, aiming is difficult using a virtual joystick. Chillyroom's solution to this problem is removing a secondary joystick for aiming weapons and instead replacing it will a single button that fires at the nearest target when pressed.

This UI makes it easy to pick-up and play this game as every major function is a button-press away from being executed.

### Features

In these tabs I will say what I want to include, may include (due to estimated difficulty or not necessary for the first release of the game), and what I don't want to include.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Features I will include" %}
| Feature          | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chests           | Soul Knight's chests contain coins and mana pickups, a weapon, or a health pick-up. Chests allow progression in rogue-like games as new weapons allow the player to progress further in the dungeon.                                                            |
| Simple Animation | The player in Soul Knight uses paper cut-out animation (similar to the Paper Mario franchise) which will be easier to implement. As well as that, weapons are held separate to the player so unique animations for each weapon aren't necessary.                |
| Weapon Classes   | Soul Knight contains a plethora of weapons which can be assigned to classes in order to make it easier to program and help the player understand how that weapon works based off their previous experiences with that class. e.g Melee weapons are close range. |
| End Goal         | After a certain number of levels the player reaches a magic crystal shard. This is good as it stops the player from becoming so overpowered and finding the game boring.                                                                                        |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Features I won't include" %}
| Feature                          | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upgrading outside of the Dungeon | Soul Knight is a rogue-lite meaning it doesn't contain permadeath. Outside of the dungeon you can upgrade characters and gain new abilities which I cannot include as I am making a rogue-like (no progression outside of the dungeon).                                                                   |
| Event Rooms                      | In Soul Knight there are event rooms marked with a yellow "!". These rooms can contain chests but usually contain shops to buy things to help your run succeed and mercenaries. I won't include these rooms as I plan to include more chests throughout each room so these rooms will become trivialized. |
| Unique Characters                | This would cuse progression outside of the dungeon as you unlock new characters so I have left this feature out of my rogue-like game.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Multiplayer                      | It will be just too complicated to include in this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Moonlighter

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cover image for the Nintendo Switch version of Moonlighter (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Moonlighter-1423773.html">https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Moonlighter-1423773.html</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Moonlighter is also a top-down 2D rogue-lite game made for PC, mobile, and console. The goal of the game  is to unlock the mysterious 5th dungeon and run a successful shop with the items the player finds in the dungeons. It hasn't got multiplayer support.

From the shop the player can get money in order to purchase new equipment and potions in order to traverse the dungeons easily and obtain the keys to unlock the final dungeon by defeating the bosses.

### Controls

As I only have played Moonlighter on PC, I will be talking about its PC controls only.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Moonlighter's keyboard controls (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Moonlighter/comments/gsfcm3/interface_repeatedly_switches_between_controller/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Moonlighter/comments/gsfcm3/interface_repeatedly_switches_between_controller/</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

Moonlighter uses the WASD keys for movement and the keys depicted in the picture for attacking \[J], rolling \[Space], healing \[E], switching weapons \[Z], and using weapon abilities \[K].

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rolling / Dodging    | Allow for quick movement and dodging attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Weapon Switching     | Allows for two weapons to be held at a time which makes the game more fun as you can switch between different weapons for more combat options.                                                                                                    |
| Portable Healing     | In Moonlighter, potions are portable so they can be used when you want them to be used. This will be good so people can stack healing (up to a maximum amount) so they can take on the boss at full health.                                       |
| 8 Direction Movement | Allows for movement in 8 directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Dungeon Generation   | Moonlighters dungeon generation makes rooms filled with enemies and destructible cover. It also generates chests in some rooms, to acquire loot, and doesn't generate corridors (unlike Soul Knight) making dungoen traversal easier and quicker. |

| Items           | There are no need for obsolete items (such as artifacts) as there won't be a shop to sell them at.                                                                                                 |
| Shop            | The premise of Moonlighter is to run a shop to get money for your expeditions to the dungeon but this isn't needed in my game as a rogue-like wouldn't allow progression outside of the main game. |
| Secret Dungeons | The wanderer dungeon is a secret dungeon you can find in Moonlighter but I won't include something similar as it may ruin progression.                                                             |
| Money           | Money isn't needed as there won't be shops to purchase goods.                                                                                                                                      |
