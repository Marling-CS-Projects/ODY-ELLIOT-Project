# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

<table><thead><tr><th width="176">Criterion</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>24</td><td>The game loading times shouldn't take too long.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>The game's FPS should be 60FPS.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>The game shouldn't crash.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Criterion 24

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXzbDvoiRU" %}
A video showing the game loading times aren't too long
{% endembed %}

This feature is shown in the above video where the longest loading time is between the game-over screen and the main menu (which is intentional).

### Criterion 25

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Image showing the game runs at 60 FPS</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Image showing that the game doesn't lag for a variety of users</p></figcaption></figure>

The images above show the game runs at a constant 60 frames per second as well as the game being lagless. This is probably because the game's memory usage is small.&#x20;

### Criterion 26

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Image showing the game downloads and runs correctly for most people</p></figcaption></figure>

According to the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewdKSRPxViHy7iZwTl3iMBZkAM8XL76dQIEQXJQ5ZiwxuIdg/viewform), only one response's game didn't run correctly. This was because they were on MacOS so I amended the store page which now specifies the game only works on Windows ([1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements](../analysis/hardware-and-software-requirements.md)). Apart from that, this feature is an overall success.
