# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the game have a clear objective?      |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls intuitive and responsive? |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the game entertaining?                  |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag or contain any bugs?     |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is the game easy to pick up for newcomers? |

To answer these questions, I created a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewdKSRPxViHy7iZwTl3iMBZkAM8XL76dQIEQXJQ5ZiwxuIdg/viewform) which I attached to the store page. I then asked my friends and family to fill it out: receiving 13 responses. Shown below are the results of the relevant questions asked and I will go over the overall results in greater depth during my project evaluation.

{% hint style="info" %}
The form was created after [Cycle 10](../design-and-development/cycle-10.md) so some questions were added later to the form so not all questions have 13 responses.
{% endhint %}

## User Feedback

### Effective

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "How well did you understand the game?"</p></figcaption></figure>

The majority of people who responded to this question understood the game well / very well. This is great as it is extremely important that the players know what to do or they won't find the game entertaining. This is probably because of the simplicity of the game due to its arcade-style gameplay.

### Efficient

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "How responsive were the controls?"</p></figcaption></figure>

The majority of users found the game's controls responsive. However, two users found them unresponsive. Later on in the form, they said the movement controls didn't function correctly as there was input lag and bugs associated with it. This was solved in v1.2 (released after [Cycle 12](../design-and-development/cycle-12.md)) so this feature is now successful.

### Engaging

</div>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "How long did you play the game for?"</p></figcaption></figure>

The majority of users played the game for a long time, liked the artwork, and liked the game's audio which suggests they found the game entertaining and fun to play. This also implies there was enough variety in the game as it kept users engaged for a long time. This was a great response to receive as it made me quite happy to see people were finding my game engaging. This also means my main goal was successful as the main goal of a game is to be entertaining.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "Did the game download and run correctly?"</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The one person whose game didn't run correctly was mentioned in [Testing for Function and Robustness](testing-for-function-and-robustness.md) and the problem came from them running the game on MacOS.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "Did the game lag?"</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Qualitative responses to the question "If there were any bugs, what were they and how did they occur?"</p></figcaption></figure>

The vast majority of users said the game downloaded and ran correctly and all respondents said the game didn't lag. This was great as this meant the game was accessible to anyone with the correct hardware and software requirements ([Hardware and Software Requirements](../analysis/hardware-and-software-requirements.md)) and the game runs smoothly throughout which makes it more entertaining to play.

In response to the bugs found in my game, I created two patches (v1.1 and v1.2), which can be found on the game's [store page](https://elliotody.itch.io/bucket-knight), which fixed these problems as well as added new features the players requested.

### Easy to Learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "How well did you understand the game?"</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "How helpful was the 'How-To-Play' screen?"</p></figcaption></figure>

All users found the How-To-Play screen helpful while learning the game's controls. This combined with the mostly positive statistics for how well players understood the game suggests that the game was easy to learn which allows players to enjoy themselves right from the beginning.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 23        | The game shouldn't contain any inappropriate content (must remain at PEGI 7 or lower) |
| 28        | The game shouldn't be too easy or too hard.                                           |

### Criterion 23

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "Did you think the game contained any inappropriate content?"</p></figcaption></figure>

For every response I received, no users thought the game contained any inappropriate content which suggests the game is suitable for a PEGI 3 rating or, at most, a PEGI 7 rating due to very mild cartoon violence. This fits the target for what I wanted to achieve for this criteria.

### Criterion 28

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Graph showing the responses to the question "How easy was the game?"</p></figcaption></figure>

The majority of users were in the Goldilox Zone saying the game wasn't 'Too Easy' nor 'Too Hard'. The was perfect as the game was challenging enough to keep players engaged without discouraging them from quitting the game entirely. These players also played for the longest time (see graph below).
