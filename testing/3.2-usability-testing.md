# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the game have a clear objective?      |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls intuitive and responsive? |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the game entertaining?                  |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag or contain any bugs?     |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is the game easy to pick up for newcomers? |

To answer these questions, I created a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewdKSRPxViHy7iZwTl3iMBZkAM8XL76dQIEQXJQ5ZiwxuIdg/viewform) which I attached to the store page. I then asked my friends and family to fill it out: receiving 13 responses. Shown below are the results of the relevant questions asked and I will go over the overall results in greater depth during my project evaluation.

Some questions were added later to the form so not all questions have 13 responses.

## User Feedback

### Effective

The majority of people who responded to this question understood the game well / very well. This is great as it is extremely important that the players know what to do or they won't find the game entertaining. This is probably because of the simplicity of the game due to its arcade-style gameplay.

### Efficient
