# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the game have a clear objective?                     |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls intuitive and are the menus easy to use? |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the game entertaining?                                 |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game lag or contain any bugs?                    |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is the game easy to pick up for newcomers?                |

To answer these questions, I created a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewdKSRPxViHy7iZwTl3iMBZkAM8XL76dQIEQXJQ5ZiwxuIdg/viewform) which I attached to the store page. I then asked my friends and family to fill it out: receiving 13 responses. Shown below are the results of the relevant questions asked and I will go over the overall results in greater depth during my project evaluation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some questions were added later to the form so not all questions have 13 responses.
